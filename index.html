        <div class="subheading mb-5">Customer Service</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a full-time student at University of Riverside California. I am currently working on my bachelors in psychology and a minor in biology.
        I am interested in pursuing a career in medicine. I hope to become a physician assistant. I try to spend most of my free time volunteering at clinics. Currently, I volunteer my time at Al-Shifa clinic. I have over 1,500 hours in volunteer experience.
        I currently have two full time jobs working in customer service. Working two full time jobs and attending school full time has improved my time management and organizational skills.
        Working as a Assistant manager has improved my decision making skills and working as a cashier has improved my mathematical skills. The experience I have gained from the customer service jobs and volunteering at clinics have really taught me how to be more patient and work as a team player.
        
        I am a quick learner and love to learn new skills. I like to be the best at whatever I chose to do. I never back away from a challenge even if there is a chance for failure. Some of the best lessons and experiences come from failure. Over the years I have focused on changing my weak points. I always had a fear of public speaking and in general I was not the best at interacting with people I do not have a history with. I started putting myself in classes where I had to do presentations and work in groups. I have been able to manage my fear of public speaking.
        
        <br><br>
        </p> Moving forward, I will be starting a new job in July 2020.  I will be starting as an ABA (Behavior Therapist) at an elementary school in Pomona for special needs kids. The company also happens to have clients at a school for deaf children in Riverside and I look forward to learning sign language to be able to communicate with the children and teachers. I have started training there recently and each child has a unique behavior and disability. My job is to help control the outburst and behaviors of these children so they can sit in the school bus and classroom without an aid being present. One of the kids I'm currently working with is an eloper and when things get tough the boy is quick to disappear. The children are very quick and intelligent and I'm going to have to be a lot quicker. Working with this company on a volunteer basis has definitely caught my interest in getting my masters in psychology and later pursuing a career as a special need's teacher. I'm just not ready to give up on becoming a Physician assistant just yet. Right now, my main goal is to learn something new every day whether it be something big or small.  Today's lesson, I need to get better at writing bios.
